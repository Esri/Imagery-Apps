Use this app to draw on Sentinel's different bands to better explore the planet's geology, vegetation, agriculture, and cities. This app covers the country of The Netherlands. Additionally, access the entire Sentinel archive to visualize how the Earth's surface has changed over the last four years.<br /><br/>To get a guided look at the Sentinel Explorer app tools, click <img src='./widgets/Tutorial/images/icon2.png' height='20' /> for a tutorial.<br /><br />For information on Esri's full imagery capabilities, visit <a href='http://www.esri.com/imagery'>http://www.esri.com/imagery</a>.<br/><br />To build your own web app like Sentinel Explorer, visit <a href='http://developers.arcgis.com'>http://developers.arcgis.com</a>.<br /><br />For more info about this app, or setting up an app like this in your own infrastructure, contact Esri Netherlands <a href='http://www.esri.nl'>http://www.esri.nl .</a></p>"
